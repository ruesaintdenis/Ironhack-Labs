7. Take a look at the data you retrieved in question 5. Give some insights.

All of the most rated apps are free, and the range of amount rated is quite high, ranging from 83k users to 3 million users. 
Only 2 apps were only offered in 1 language, and the other 8 were offered in 10 or more languages. The most frequent genre is Games, 
which is aligned with the answer in Question 3, and then it's Social Media and Music, followed by Photography and Reference. 

8. Take a look at the data you retrieved in question 6. Give some insights.

Not all of the apps are free, with 4/10 being paid apps. All but 1 are classified as games, and only 3 are offered in 10 languages or more. 
The range of the amount of rating is less than in the previous question, ranging from 16k-48k. 

9. Now compare the data from questions 5 and 6. What do you see?

None of the most rated are the best rated. 

10. How could you take the top 3 regarding both user ratings and number of votes?

Well, since I sorted by both rating and number of votes, I think it accurately represents the apps that most users love the most. 

11. Do people care about the price of an app? Do some queries, comment why are you doing them and the results you retrieve. What is your conclusion?

To determine if users were happy, I decided to look at the percentage of apps that were rated 4 or above when they were free compared
to when they were paid apps. It seems paid apps are more likely to be rated 4 or above, with 46% of paid apps being rated 4 or above, 
compared to only 42% of free apps. However, it is unknown whether this difference is significant.
